# flatbush

A really fast **static spatial index** for 2D points and rectangles in JavaScript.

An efficient implementation of the [packed Hilbert R-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_R-tree#Packed_Hilbert_R-trees) algorithm. Enables fast spatial queries on a very large number of objects (e.g. millions), which is very useful in maps, data visualizations and computational geometry algorithms.

Similar to [RBush](https://github.com/mourner/rbush), with the following key differences:

- **Static**: you can't add/remove items after initial indexing.
- **Faster** indexing and search, with much lower **memory** footprint.
- Index is stored as a single **typed array** (which can be [transfered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Transferable)).

## Example

```js
// initialize flatbush for 1000 items
const index = flatbush(1000);

// fill it with 1000 rectangles
for (const p of itemsToIndex) {
    index.add(p.minX, p.minY, p.maxX, p.maxY);
}

// perform the indexing
index.finish();

// make a bounding box query
index.search(minX, minY, maxX, maxY, (i) => {
    console.log(`found ${itemsToIndex[i]}`);
});

```

## API

#### flatbush(numItems)

Creates a `flatbush` index for storing a given number of items (`numItems`).

#### index.add(minX, minY, maxX, maxY)

Adds a given rectangle to the index.

#### index.finish()

Performs indexing of the added rectangles.
Their number must match the one provided when creating a `flatbush` object.

#### index.search(minX, minY, maxX, maxY, visitorFn)

Calls `visitorFn(i)` on every item that intersects a given rectangular query,
where `i` is the index of the item according to the order it was added.

## Performance
